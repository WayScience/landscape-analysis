            <li><strong>Description:</strong>
        This plot explores the user bases of relevant projects
        through relative GitHub stars and the age of the project in years.
        GitHub stars are an indication of unique users whom are interested
        in and likely use the project somehow.
        </li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong>
        We observe that projects of greater age are not always those with the most stars.
        Projects of the <code>loi-focus</code> category  (e.g., pycytominer) are generally
        in an early state of their user base (both in age and stars),
        relative to other projects (e.g., Napari). We note the limitations of using stars
        to gauge community engagement given many projects do not focus efforts on developers.

            <li><strong>Description:</strong>
        This plot demonstrates the magnitude of total GitHub stars by project and category.
        Click the category boxes to zoom into focus on only those projects.
        </li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong>
        Here we can see the <code>relevant open source</code> category far outsize other categories.
        Within the <code>microscopy analysis tools</code> category we observe that Napari has many more stars than others.
        Projects of the <code>loi-focus</code> category are emerging with a growing community base, but not are not as established as other tools with
        much greater age.
        </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Maturity</h2><p>
    This section seeks to demonstrate relative project maturity by leveraging age,
    relative activity, GitHub stars, and total lines of code.

            <li><strong>Description:</strong>
        This plot shows the lines of code (LoC) and age in years to help indicate relative project maturity.
        Lines of code in this case are the sum total of all detected programming languages in the latest version of the GitHub repository.
        </li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong>
        We observe that many tools within the Cytomining Ecosystem landscape reside within a tight range
        of total lines of code (relative to others), and that projects of greater age do not necessarily have more code.

            <li><strong>Description:</strong>
        This plot demonstrates project GitHub stars and most recent commit datetime as a way to observe
        potential decay for projects which may have been popular at one point but are no longer maintained.
        </li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong>
        We find that relevant open source, microscopy analysis tools, and tools of <code>loi-focus</code> are
        all recently updated. Adjacent tools demonstrate historical usage but are somewhat less frequently maintained.
        Many tools from GitHub queries show a lack of updates for greater than 2 years.
        We hypothesize that many GitHub projects re-invent functionality related to the Cytomining Ecosystem.
        These projects are sometimes abandoned after authors perform bespoke or one-time analyses.
        </li>

            <h2>Usage</h2><p>

            <li><strong>Description:</strong>
        This plot shows project GitHub watcher and GitHub fork count
        as a way to demonstrate relative usage.
        </li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong>
        We see a wide variety of project watcher and fork count depending on the category.
        Generally, projects of <code>loi-focus</code> are emerging tools that are at an earlier stage and thus have fewer forks and watchers.

            <li><strong>Description:</strong>
        This plot shows the number of project contributors and issue counts as a way to describe usage through maintainability.
        </li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong>
        We find that many projects have a high contributor and issue count.
        A few examples in the <code>adjacent tools</code> and <code>microscopy analysis tools</code> categories are trending toward tools
        in the <code>relevant open source</code> category.
        Projects of <code>loi-focus</code> are nearby many landscape neighbors in the middle of this plot.

            <h2>General landscape</h2><p>
    This section visualizes broader aspects of the software landscape such as primary language preference and
    GitHub organization metrics.

            <li><strong>Description:</strong>
        This plot shows the primary programming language project count colored by category.
        A primary programming language is derived from the maximum lines of code from GitHub-detected programming languages.
        </li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong>
        We observe that R, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks are among the most popular primary programming languages found
        within the Cytomining Ecosystem software landscape.

        This plot shows the count of projects per GitHub organization (a collection of repositories)
        for those organizations with more than 2 projects.

            <li><strong>Findings:</strong> Here we find that the Theis Lab, UC Davis Bioinformatics Training, and Teich Lab are at the top of this listing. Cytomining is also near the top of the list, which is a code base that supports essential functionality that does not exist in any other open source organization that is actively maintained.</li>

        This plot shows the sum of GitHub stars per GitHub organization for those with a sum total of stars greater than 100.
        </li>
            <li><strong>Findings:</strong> Here we can observe that scverse, Theis Lab, and Satija Lab organizations hold the top count of GitHub stars. The Cytomining organization is found near the middle of this visualization, indicating similar popularity and early success in audience outreach amidst those within the related landscape.</li>
